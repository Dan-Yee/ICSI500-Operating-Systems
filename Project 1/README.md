# Programming Project 1
The goal of this project was to create a synchronous Producer and Consumer to simulate data transmission. 

Transmission for this project was simulated using files. The Producer encoded and wrote data to a binary file. The Consumer read from that binary file and decoded the data back to its original form.
An Error Creation module was also created to simulate transmission errors. The module randomly flips a varying number of bits in the encoded message to cause an error in the data.
