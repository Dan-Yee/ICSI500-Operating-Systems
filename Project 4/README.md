# Programming Project 4
The goal of this project was to modify Project 3 and change the implementation of the producer and consumer. Instead of inter-process commmunication through a pipe, we were to modify our project to complete that task using a server/client implementation through a TCP socket. We were also required to modify the data on the server side through multi-threading.

The server can be executed using: ./server port_number

The client can be executed using: ./client localhost port_number
